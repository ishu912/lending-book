    "text": "Preface\nThis book is about merchant lending — the economics of how checkout finance works, how no-cost EMIs actually work, and where the money really comes from. If you build fintech products, manage payments, or work in lending, this book is for you.\nMerchant lending in India is growing fast. Millions of customers now buy now and pay later at checkout. Thousands of merchants offer no-cost EMI. But most people in product and payments don’t deeply understand the numbers underneath. They see “0%” and assume no money changes hands. They don’t know about subvention. They don’t know why checkout finance is more expensive than home loans. They don’t know what the merchant actually pays for.\nThat’s what this book fixes.\nWe’ll start with the foundations. What is lending, really? What is subvention? How much does money cost? Then we’ll move to the specific math: how to calculate the cost of a no-cost EMI, how checkout finance economics work, why credit cards are built the way they are. Finally, we’ll give you the tools to negotiate with lenders as a merchant or partner.\nThe book assumes you understand products and business. It assumes nothing about finance. Every concept has a concrete example in rupees. We speak plainly and avoid jargon. When a technical term is needed, we explain it right away.",

Collateral. When you borrow for a home and can’t repay, the lender takes the house. When you borrow for a personal loan and can’t repay, the lender has nothing. The lender’s money is at much more risk. So they charge more.\nUnsecured loans also last shorter. A personal loan is typically 2-4 years. A home loan is 20 years. The shorter the loan, the faster the lender gets their money back. If something goes wrong, they lose money for shorter period.\nCheckout EMIs and credit cards are the riskiest in this list. No collateral. The customer can simply not pay. So yields are high — 20%+ is common.",

    "text": "1.3 What Is Subvention?\nSubvention is the interest income that the lender would have earned from the customer, but instead the merchant pays it upfront so the customer gets 0% EMI.\nLet’s use a concrete example.\nA customer buys a ₹30,000 product at a store and pays in 6 equal installments. If the lender charged the standard 22% annual interest, the customer would pay extra money each month. But the merchant wants to offer 0%.\nHere’s what happens: The lender calculates the 22% IRR upfront. This comes to about ₹3,500 in total interest income. Instead of collecting this from the customer, the merchant pays this ₹3,500 to the lender at the time of purchase. The customer then pays ₹5,000 per month for 6 months — exactly the original loan amount divided equally.\nThe customer sees 0% interest. The lender earned 22% IRR anyway. The merchant paid ₹3,500 for the privilege. Everyone is happy.\nThis is subvention.\nSubvention is a subsidy. The merchant is subsidizing the interest so the customer saves money. Why? Because the merchant wants the sale. They’re willing to pay for the convenience of financing.\nThe economics are wild. The lender’s IRR stays the same. The customer’s interest rate drops to 0%. The merchant pays the difference. This only works if the merchant’s profit margin on the product is high enough to absorb the cost.",

When a customer doesn’t pay the ₹100 today but spreads it over 6 months, the lender finances it. The merchant compensates the lender for the interest cost and risk.\nThe key difference: credit costs more than processing. A merchant paying 2% for card processing is getting a much better deal than a merchant paying 8% for subvention. Why? Because with a card, the money is in the merchant’s account in 2 seconds.

Their economics show how merchant lending really works.\nBajaj earns money from several streams:\n\nSubvention — The merchant pays upfront. This is the biggest source.\nProcessing fees — The customer or merchant pays a small fee (~1-2%) to set up the loan.\nLate fees — If the customer misses a payment, Bajaj charges a late fee. This is 2-4% per month.\nCross-sell — Bajaj markets credit cards and insurance to customers who get a loan. Extra revenue.\nFloat — Bajaj takes customer’s money at the beginning of the month (with salary), but the customer’s bills are due in the middle. Bajaj earns interest on this money for 2 weeks.\n\nThe point: a lender in merchant lending isn’t just earning interest. They’re earning fees, late fees, and income from investments. The subvention is the core, but it’s not the only lever.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteMemorize This\n\n\n\nLending is about the spread. A lender borrows money at one rate and lends at another.

The spread is massive and stable.\nThis is why banks dominate retail lending and keep it cheap.\nNBFCs don’t have customer deposits. They have to borrow from banks or issue bonds in the market. These are expensive sources. Banks charge NBFCs 8-11% when they lend to them. The market charges 9-12% when NBFCs issue bonds. So the NBFC’s cost of funds is much higher.\nFintechs have it even harder. They’re new and small. Banks are hesitant to lend to them at cheap rates. They often borrow at 12-16%.

    "text": "3.2 Why “NPV = 0” Doesn’t Mean Zero Profit\nThis is the biggest misconception about IRR. People hear “NPV equals zero” and think the lender made no money. Wrong.\nNPV = 0 at a certain discount rate means the lender earned exactly that discount rate. That IS the profit.\nHere’s an analogy. You deposit ₹1 lakh in a fixed deposit at 8% interest per year. After one year, the bank gives you back ₹1,08,000. The net present value at 8% discount rate is zero. Does that mean you made no profit? No. You made ₹8,000 in profit. That’s 8% of your money.\nThe “zero NPV” is just the math at the rate you earned. It’s not saying you made nothing. It’s identifying the rate itself.\nLet’s use a lending example.\nA lender gives out a ₹30,000 loan. The customer pays ₹5,000 per month for 6 months. The lender also gets ₹3,500 upfront as a processing fee.\nCashflows: - Day 0: Lender gives out -₹30,000 - Day 0: Lender gets back +₹3,500 (fee) - Month 1: Lender gets +₹5,000 - Month 2: Lender gets +₹5,000 - … and so on until Month 6.\nThe lender invested ₹26,500 (₹30,000 - ₹3,500) and got back ₹30,000 (6 × ₹5,000). The profit is ₹3,500. The IRR is the rate that makes the NPV of all these cashflows equal to zero. It turns out to be 22%.\nAt a 22% discount rate, the NPV is exactly zero. The lender earned 22% IRR.\nThis 22% includes: - The principal repayment - The timing of repayments - The upfront fee\nNone of this is “zero profit.” It’s 22% annual profit.",

    "text": "3.3 IRR vs the Interest Rate Shown to Customers\nThe interest rate advertised to customers is NOT the IRR. This is crucial.\nWhen a lender advertises “9% personal loan,” that 9% is the interest rate. It’s calculated on the original loan amount. It doesn’t include fees. It doesn’t account for the fact that the customer pays off the loan gradually (so the average balance outstanding is less than the original amount). The 9% is a simplified number.\nThe IRR includes everything: interest, fees, and the timing of when money moves.\nHere are the differences:\n\n\n\nFeature\nStated Rate\nIRR\n\n\n\n\nIncludes processing fee?\nNo\nYes\n\n\nAccounts for repayment timing?\nPartially\nYes\n\n\nAccounts for amortization?\nPartially\nYes\n\n\nAccounts for late charges?\nNo\nYes (expected)\n\n\nEasy to compare?\nSometimes\nYes\n\n\n\nExample 1: 0% EMI\nA checkout finance lender offers 0% EMI to customers. The stated rate is 0%. But the lender gets ₹3,500 upfront as a processing fee on a ₹30,000 loan. The lender’s IRR is 22%.\nThe customer thinks they’re borrowing at 0%. The lender is earning 22%. Both are technically correct. The lender’s 22% includes the upfront fee the customer paid (or the merchant paid).\nExample 2: Home Loan\nA bank offers a home loan at 9% interest per year. The customer also pays a ₹50,000 processing fee on a ₹50,00,000 loan. The stated rate is 9%. The true IRR is about 9.5% once you account for the fee, the timing of repayments, and the amortization schedule.\nThis might seem like a small difference. But on a 20-year loan, it compounds to a lot.\nExample 3: Flat Rate vs Reducing Balance\nSome lenders quote “10% flat” interest. This is confusing. It means 10% of the original amount, paid back in equal monthly installments.\nLet’s say you borrow ₹10,000 at 10% flat for 12 months.\n\nTotal interest paid: ₹1,000 (10% of ₹10,000)\nTotal repayment: ₹11,000\nMonthly payment: ₹916.67\n\nBut here’s the catch. You’re paying ₹916.67 per month even though the outstanding balance decreases. In month 1, you owe ₹10,000 and pay ₹916.67. In month 12, you owe ₹916.67 and pay ₹916.67. You’re paying the same amount regardless of how much you owe.\nThe IRR on this loan is not 10%. It’s about 18-20%. Why? Because the interest is charged on the full amount for the full term, even though you’ve already paid down half the loan.\nThis is why reducing balance is always cheaper than flat rate. In reducing balance, interest is charged only on the outstanding balance.",

It’s the true cost of the loan.\nWhy did RBI introduce this? Because lenders could advertise “9% interest” and hide the actual cost in processing fees, late fees, and other charges. APR makes it harder to hide.\nFor checkout finance, APR disclosure is important. A 0% EMI product looks free. But if there’s a processing fee, that fee should appear in the APR.

    "text": "3.5 IRR vs Total Revenue — The Prepayment Paradox\nHere’s a quirk of lending economics that confuses many people.\nWhen a customer prepays a loan (pays it off early), the lender’s IRR goes up but total revenue goes down.\nExample:\nA lender gives a ₹1,00,000 personal loan at 18% IRR over 5 years. The lender expects to earn ₹58,000 in total interest.\nBut the customer prepays after 2 years. The lender gets their principal back plus 2 years of interest. The IRR remains 18%, but the total interest earned is only ₹20,000 instead of ₹58,000.\nThis seems backwards. The IRR stayed the same, but the lender earned less money. Why?\nIRR is the annual rate of return on the money invested, per year. If you earn ₹18 per ₹100 per year, the IRR is 18%, whether you lend for 2 years or 5 years. The total interest earned depends on how long you lend.\nThis is why banks hate prepayment. The IRR doesn’t change, but they lose money. Some loans have prepayment penalties to compensate.\nIn merchant lending (checkout finance, no-cost EMI), prepayment is common. Customers pay off 6-month EMIs early, or miss a payment. Lenders have to factor prepayment risk into their IRR calculations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantMemorize This\n\n\n\nIRR is the annual profit rate on a loan, including all fees and the timing of cashflows. A stated interest rate is not the same as IRR. IRR is the true cost to the borrower and true profit to the lender. APR is the customer-friendly way to express IRR. When prepayment happens, IRR stays the same but total revenue drops — which is why lenders don’t like prepayment.",

    "text": "4.1 The Five Components\nA lender’s required Internal Rate of Return (IRR) is not a magic number pulled from thin air. It’s the answer to a simple question: “How much return do I need to make this loan worth the risk?”\nThe answer is always the same: add up five things. Every rupee the merchant pays flows into one of these five buckets. This chapter shows you how.\nWhen a lender decides they need, say, 18% IRR on a merchant credit product, they’re actually saying: “These five costs and profit targets add up to 18%.”\nComponent 1: Cost of Funds\nFirst, the lender has to borrow money to lend to you. That costs them something.\nThis is their baseline cost. If they lend at anything below this rate, they lose money before we even count risk or operations.\nComponent 2: Expected Credit Loss\nSome borrowers will default. You know this. So does the lender.\nExpected Loss = Probability of Default × Loss Given Default\nSuppose the lender expects 3% of merchants to default. And when they default, the lender recovers 40% of the loan (sells inventory, collateral, etc). Then:\nLoss Given Default = 1 - 0.40 = 60% Expected Loss = 3% × 60% = 1.8% of the loan amount\nA ₹100,000 loan in this scenario costs the lender ₹1,800 in expected losses, baked into the price.\nComponent 3: Operating Cost\nRunning the lending business costs money. KYC checks. Underwriting. Servicing. Collections.\nFor merchant lending, this typically runs 1-3% of the loan amount annually.\nA ₹100,000 loan might cost ₹1,000-3,000 to originate, service, and potentially collect on.\nComponent 4: Capital/Regulatory Charge\nBanks must hold capital against every loan they make. An 8% capital adequacy requirement means that on a ₹1,00,000 portfolio, they must hold ₹8,000 in capital.\nThat capital has a cost. It needs to earn the bank’s cost of equity (typically 15-20% per year). So even though they’re only holding 8%, the cost per loan works out to roughly 1-2% IRR.\nThis is pure regulation. It exists to make the banking system safer. The lender passes it to you.\nComponent 5: Required Profit\nAfter costs, the lender wants profit. Shareholders expect a Return on Assets (ROA) — profit as a percentage of assets — of 2-4% per year on average.",

This chapter shows you the math.\nWe’ll move from the real calculations to a simple formula you can use on the back of an envelope.\nLet’s trace a ₹30,000 no-cost EMI loan over six months.\nMonth 0 (Disbursement): - Lender pays merchant ₹30,000 - Merchant pays subvention S to the lender (e.g., ₹1,500 = 5%) - Lender pays origination/servicing cost εP (let’s say ε = 1%, so ₹300) - Net lender cash out: ₹30,000 - ₹1,500 + ₹300 = ₹28,800\nMonths 1-6 (Collections): - Customer pays EMI of ₹30,000/6 = ₹5,000 each month\nExpected Loss: Sometime around month 3 (the midpoint), the lender will face expected losses. If loss rate = 2%, that’s ₹600 they won’t collect.\nHere’s the cashflow table:\nThe lender’s job is to find the subvention S that makes the NPV of this cashflow equal to zero at their required IRR.",

The lender gets principal back monthly, so they’re not actually earning 24% on the full amount for six months.\nHere’s the intuition: if you lend ₹30,000 and get ₹5,000 back each month, by month 4 you only have ₹10,000 still deployed. You can’t earn 24% on ₹10,000 when you’re only owed ₹10,000. The math doesn’t work.\nThe real answer accounts for this: the lender only needs 8-9% subvention on a 6-month EMI to hit 24% IRR, not 12%.\nThis is why simple “2% per month” estimates are always too high.

This chapter shows you how each one works and how they combine to reduce what you actually have to pay.\nFloat is money sitting idle in someone’s account before it needs to go somewhere else.\nWhen you deposit ₹1,000 in your savings account and it earns 4% interest per year, you’re earning on float. The bank takes your money, deploys it elsewhere at higher rates, and gives you 4%. That 4% is the value of float.\nIn merchant lending, float works the same way. EMI money pools in accounts, refunds accumulate, brand subsidy funds sit waiting. The lender invests this idle cash in short-term money market instruments (bonds, reverse repos, T-bills) earning 5-8% per year.\nThis float income reduces the subvention the lender needs from you.",

The cash sits in a pooling account earning interest for 1-3 days before it’s reconciled against the loan ledger.\n₹1 crore in EMI collections earning 6% float for 2 days = ₹1,00,00,000 × 0.06 ÷ 365 × 2 = ₹32,877 of free money.\nRefund Pools\nWhen a customer returns a product (within 30 days for appliances, 10 days for electronics), the refund goes into a pool. It sits for 2-7 days before it’s matched to a customer account and reversed.\nIf the NBFC has ₹50 lakh in refunds sitting for an average of 4 days: ₹50,00,000 × 0.06 ÷ 365 × 4 = ₹32,877.\nStaggered Disbursements\nSome lenders disburse in stages. They approve for ₹30,000 but release ₹10,000 at purchase, ₹10,000 at delivery, ₹10,000 at final inspection. Money that was supposed to be out sits earning float between tranches.\nBrand Subsidy Pools\nWhen a brand (like Samsung or LG) subsidizes EMI schemes, they deposit funds upfront. The lender invests this until it’s deployed against actual loans. Brand deposit of ₹1 crore at 7% earning float for 2 months = ₹1,00,00,000 × 0.07 ÷ 12 × 2 = ₹11.67 lakhs.",

The T+1 delay is just about ledger posting, not about earning on idle money.\n\nScenario 3: T+1 Settlement WITH Float (Pooling)\n\nDay 1: Customer buys for ₹30,000 EMI\nDay 1-15: Many customers make payments throughout the month\nDay 15: Lender has ₹50 lakh in unposted EMI payments sitting in a transaction account\nDay 16-17: These payments are reconciled, netted, and posted to loans\nResult: ₹50 lakh earned float for 1-2 days while sitting idle.\n\nThe float comes from batching, not from T+1 settlement itself. T+1 is about when you get paid. Float is about how long money sits in the lender’s account earning interest.",

    "text": "6.4 How Float Reduces Subvention\nEvery percentage point of float yield saves you roughly 0.3-0.5% in subvention, depending on tenure.\nHere’s why: in a 6-month EMI, the lender has money outstanding for an average of 3.5 months. If they’re earning 6% float on average balances for 3.5 months, that’s:\nFloat income = Average balance × 6% × (3.5/12) = Average balance × 1.75%\nSince average balance on a ₹30,000 loan is ₹15,000, float income is roughly ₹262. That’s worth about 0.87% of the original ₹30,000 principal. So 6% float yield saves roughly 0.87% in subvention on a 6-month loan.\n\n\n\nTenure\nFloat Yield → Subvention Savings\n\n\n\n\n1-month\n6% float → saves ~0.5% subvention\n\n\n3-month\n6% float → saves ~1.0% subvention\n\n\n6-month\n6% float → saves ~1.75% subvention\n\n\n12-month\n6% float → saves ~3.0% subvention\n\n\n\nA 6-month loan that would need 10% subvention at 0% float only needs 8.25% subvention if the lender earns 6% float.\nThis is why lenders obsess over float. It’s free money. It improves unit economics without touching the merchant economics.",

If you charge the customer 2% and reduce subvention by 2%, the lender’s IRR stays the same but the merchant cost drops.\nThe GST Nuance:\nProcessing fees are taxable. On a ₹600 fee, GST is 18%: ₹108.\nSo the customer pays ₹708, and the lender keeps ₹600 after remitting ₹108 to the government. Net to lender = ₹600, but customer sees ₹708.\nFrom the merchant’s perspective, if the lender says “we’ll charge the customer 3% processing fee instead of asking you for 3% subvention,” the merchant sees a win (no cost to them). The lender still gets the rupees they need, just from a different pocket.",

If you buy a ₹10,000 outfit on EMI and can’t pay, the lender can’t do much. You just don’t pay.\nTiming of Default Matters:\nA customer who defaults in month 1 (after paying just one ₹5,000 EMI) costs the lender nearly the full ₹25,000.\nA customer who defaults in month 5 (after paying ₹25,000) costs the lender only ₹5,000.\nThis is why default rates are tracked by cohort and vintages.

The ROI on subvention is typically 2-4x. Loss rates are portfolio metrics, not monthly. Appliance defaults (1-2%) are vastly lower than personal loan defaults (5-10%) because the product is collateral.",

It’s exactly analogous to checkout finance subvention, just with a much shorter tenure.\nIn checkout finance: - Tenure: 3-12 months - Subvention: 3-10%\nIn credit cards: - Tenure: 45 days (interest-free period) - MDR: 0.5-2%\nSame mechanism, different duration.\nWhy MDR Is Lower Than EMI Subvention:\nWhen a customer buys ₹30,000 on a card, the merchant gets paid in 2 days (T+2 settlement). The cardholder pays the bank in 45 days. The bank’s capital is only deployed for 45 days instead of 6 months.\nUsing the subvention formula from Chapter 5:\n\\[\\text{Take%} \\approx (R - F) \\cdot \\frac{n+1}{24} + \\varepsilon + L\\]\nFor 45-day card payment (1.5 months):\nTake% ≈ (24% - 6%) × (1.5+1)/24 + 1% + 0.5% = 18% × 0.104 + 1.5% = 1.9% + 1.5% = 3.4%\nSo MDR on a card should be roughly 1.5-3.5% depending on the bank’s cost of funds and risk model. This lines up with actual MDR (0.5-2% is for the network fee paid by merchant’s bank; the card issuer gets a cut of this plus interchange, which totals 1.5-3%).",

    "text": "8.4 Why Card APR Is Higher Than Personal Loan APR\nYou can get a personal loan from Bajaj Finance at 12-15% APR.\nYou can get a credit card from the same bank at 36-42% APR.\nWhy is unsecured revolving credit 3x as expensive as unsecured installment credit?\nThree reasons:\n1. Open-Ended vs Closed-Ended\nA personal loan has a fixed amount and fixed schedule. You borrow ₹1 lakh, you owe ₹1 lakh + interest. Predictable.\nA credit card is open-ended. You have a ₹5 lakh limit. You might spend ₹50,000 in month 1 and ₹4 lakh in month 3. The bank doesn’t know what’s coming.\n2. Duration Uncertainty\nA personal loan matures in 36 months. The bank knows exactly when money is coming back.\nA credit card revolver might carry their balance for 2 months or 24 months. They might clear it suddenly or slowly increase it. The duration is uncertain.\n3. Behavioral Unpredictability\nSomeone taking a personal loan signed up for a schedule. If they miss a payment, it’s a break from normal.\nA credit card revolver is already missing payments or making only minimum due. They’re signaling financial stress. The bank prices for higher probability of future stress.\nThe Math:\nPersonal loan at 15% APR: - Cost of funds: 5% - Expected loss: 2% - Opex: 1% - Capital charge: 1% - Profit margin: 6%\nCredit card at 40% APR: - Cost of funds: 5% - Expected loss: 8% (revolvers have higher default rates) - Opex: 1% - Capital charge: 1% - Profit margin: 25% (to compensate for the risk and uncertain duration)\nThe extra 25% APR on cards reflects the extra 6% loss rate and requires fatter profit margins to absorb volatility.",

    "text": "8.5 Why Card Losses Are Manageable\nIf card APR is 40% but loss rates are only 5-8%, the math seems fragile. One bad quarter and losses eat all the profit.\nCard issuers manage this through aggressive loss mitigation:\nMinimum Due Enforcement: Customers must pay at least 5% of the balance every month. This ensures some cash flow even from stressed borrowers.\nDynamic Credit Limits: If you miss a payment, your limit drops immediately. If you’re delinquent for 60+ days, your card is blocked.\nEarly Collections: Most issuers call customers at day 1 of missed payment. Day 5, SMS reminder. Day 15, aggressive phone calls. Day 30, legal notice. By the time you’re written off at day 90+, the bank has already recovered 30-50% of the defaulted amount through collections.\nBehavioral Bureau Pressure: A missed payment goes to CIBIL. Your CIBIL score tanks. This social/financial pressure makes people prioritize credit card payments over other debts.\nRelationship Leverage: Card issuers know your salary, employer, and linked savings account. They can (with RBI approval) request wage garnishment or set-off from the savings account.\nTaken together, these tools reduce lifetime default rates on cards to 5-8% despite 40% APR, whereas unsecured personal loans see 5-10% default at 15% APR.\nThe portfolio math works because: - Transactors (65%) generate profit via interchange and pay zero interest - Revolvers (35%) generate profit via interest, and most of their defaults are recovered via collections by day 90",

    "text": "8.6 The Complete Picture\nCredit cards are priced higher than personal loans not because of interest rates alone, but because of: 1. Revolving risk (duration + amount uncertain) 2. Behavioral unpredictability (revolvers are already stressed) 3. Multiple revenue streams (interchange, interest, fees) that need to be managed together 4. A portfolio structure where transactors subsidize revolvers\nThe 40% APR on a card revolver is expensive, but the bank prices it this way because the alternative (refusing to lend to revolvers) would eliminate 30-40% of their customer base and the profitable interest revenue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nMemorize This\nCredit cards have multiple revenue streams: interchange (1-2%), interest (2-3%), fees (0.5-1.5%) = 3.5-6.5% total portfolio yield. Transactors (60-70%) subsidize revolvers (30-40%) because revolvers carry high balances at 36-42% APR. Card APR is 3x personal loan APR because duration is uncertain, behavior is unpredictable, and losses are higher. Loss mitigation (limits, collections, bureau) keeps card defaults to 5-8% despite this high leverage.",

    "text": "9.1 Capital-Scarce Lenders (NBFCs, Fintechs)\nThere’s a puzzle in lending — some lenders love short-tenure loans while others hate them. Both are being rational. The difference is their business model.\nNBFCs and fintechs borrow expensive money. Every rupee they borrow costs them something. So their strategy is elegant: lend → get money back fast → lend again → multiply returns on that same capital.\nThink of it like a street vendor with a cart. If you have ₹10,000 in cash, you want to turn it twice a day, not once a week. Turn it fast, keep margins tight, but do volume.\nThey love short tenure because capital turns faster. A ₹10,000 loan at 24% IRR, repaid in 3 months, lets you redeploy that capital 4 times per year. Same ₹10,000, four shots at 24% IRR.\nExamples everywhere: Bajaj CD loans (9-12 months), BNPL (3-6 months), merchant cash advance (repaid in 3-4 months out of daily sales).\nThe optimization formula is simple:\nSo a 24% IRR on a 3-month loan gives ROA = 4 × 24% = 96%. On a 12-month loan? ROA = 1 × 24% = 24%. Same IRR, but you get four times the return on assets by doing it faster.",

    "text": "9.5 Why Banks Don’t Chase Small Consumer Loans\nBanks could technically enter checkout finance. Most have. But they don’t push hard. Five reasons:\n\nTerrible unit economics on small tickets. A ₹5,000 loan and a ₹50,000 loan cost almost the same to underwrite, approve, and service. Margins get razor-thin. NBFCs can live with 1-2% net margins because they move volume and turn capital. Banks can’t.\nCapital deployment mismatch. Banks have ₹50 crore to deploy. They’d rather make one ₹50 crore home loan than 10,000 ₹5,000 checkout loans. Same upfront work, but the big loan funds faster.\nNo pricing power in no-cost EMI. Checkout finance is sold as “no cost.” The subvention comes from the merchant. The bank can’t raise the interest rate. So yield is capped. That doesn’t work for capital-intensive operations.\nWeak collections for small overdues. If a customer is 10 days late on a ₹50 lakh home loan, the bank’s collection calls matter. For a ₹5,000 loan, the cost of collection exceeds recovery. You swallow the loss.\nRegulatory burden is the same. A ₹5,000 consumer loan and a ₹10 lakh consumer loan need the same RBI compliance, the same credit bureau reporting, the same regulatory capital. So the cost-to-serve per rupee deployed is much higher on the small loan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nBanks and NBFCs aren’t being irrational about tenure preferences. They’re optimizing for different constraints. A bank that chases short-tenure small loans is destroying shareholder value. An NBFC that locks capital in long-tenure loans is doing the same. Each is right for their model.",

One flow, one approval, one set of T&Cs.\n\n\n\n10.2.2 Banks\n\nDirect checkout access. No BNPL middleman taking margin. No card network taking swipe fee.\nHigh capital turnover. Loans repaid in 3-6 months. Capital redeployed. Much faster than home loans.\nPL-quality underwriting. You already have their customer data, bank statement, CIBIL. Approval is confidence, not guessing.\nVery low acquisition cost. Merchant integration costs far less than advertising BNPL apps. You reach customers where they already are.\n\n\n\n10.2.3 Merchants\n\nZero MDR. UPI has near-zero transaction cost. No 1.5% card MDR. No 2-3% BNPL commission.\nZero subvention. Customer bears the interest rate (18% IRR, not subsidized). Or rate is low enough to be profitable without subvention.\nInstant conversion. No customer friction. No app download. No “apply for BNPL” step. “Would you like EMI?” → Yes → Done.\n\n\n\n10.2.4 NBFCs\nThis is massive disruption. Their POS moat collapses.\nToday, NBFCs win checkout finance because: - They lend fast with minimal documentation. - They have POS integration and subvention models. - They compete on low subvention (5-8%).\nIf a bank offers a credit line at 18% IRR with zero subvention, the NBFC’s subvention model breaks. The merchant asks: why pay 6% subvention to an NBFC when I can offer 0% via bank credit with no cost to me?\nNBFCs will survive in niches: - Very high-risk segments (personal loans to self-employed, informal workers). - Very small loans where banks won’t lend (₹1,000-₹5,000). - Geographic gaps where bank presence is weak.\nBut the core checkout market goes to banks.\n\n\n10.2.5 BNPL\nNearly dead. BNPL’s entire value prop is: “No-cost checkout lending.” But if a bank offers 18% IRR credit line (cheaper to customer than BNPL’s subvention), with UPI integration (no app needed), BNPL has no story.\nBNPL companies will pivot. Some become payment platforms. Some become credit aggregators. Few remain pure BNPL lenders.\n\n\n10.2.6 Credit Cards\nSignificant threat, but not death. Cards retain advantages: - Rewards. Cashback, miles, points. Credit lines have none. - International. Credit lines work in India. Cards work globally. - Premium. High-spend customers like the card status, lounge access, concierge. - Flexibility. Credit cards let you revolve (pay minimum, keep balance). Credit lines push EMI. Cards let you choose.\nSo cards become premium products. Middle market tilts to credit lines. BNPL shrinks.",

The gap is real and comes from subvention + processing fee + time value of upfront money.\nProcessing fees have outsized impact. A 2.5% fee nearly doubled IRR because upfront cash has maximum compounding benefit.\nThe back-of-envelope formula gives negotiation-grade accuracy. It pointed to ~25% when true IRR was 40%. The gap comes from high monthly rates and front-loaded income. For deals, always verify with a spreadsheet.\nLow-cost EMI with customer interest can save merchants 2-3% in subvention while barely denting lender returns.\nCredit losses matter a lot. A 2% loss reduced IRR by 6 points. Every percent of loss assumption directly raises what the merchant must pay.\nEverything connects: Cost of funds (Chapter 2) sets the floor. The five-component IRR formula (Chapter 4) determines the target. The subvention formula (Chapter 5) converts that to a per-transaction cost. Float and fees (Chapter 6) adjust the final number. And the negotiation playbook (Chapter 12) helps you challenge any inflated asks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteMemorize This\n\n\n\nOn a 6-month checkout EMI at ₹60,000: with 5.5% subvention + 2.5% processing fee, the lender earns ~40% annual IRR.

This chapter gives you tools to negotiate lending economics — whether you’re a fintech negotiating with lenders, a merchant negotiating subvention, or a product manager designing pricing.\nYou’re in a room. A lender quotes you subvention. It feels high. What do you do?\nStep 1: Ask the IRR target. “What IRR are you targeting on this portfolio?”\nListen. They’ll say something like 24%. Or 28%. That’s your anchor.\nStep 2: Compute the required subvention. Use the formula from Chapter 5:\n\\[\\text{Take\\%} \\approx \\frac{(R - F) \\cdot (n + 1)}{24} + \\varepsilon + L\\]\nWhere: - \\(R\\) = IRR target (e.g., 24%) - \\(F\\) = funding cost (e.g., 10%) - \\(n\\) = tenure in months (e.g., 6) - \\(\\varepsilon\\) = opex cost (e.g., 1%) - \\(L\\) = loss rate (e.g., 2%)\nStep 3: Work the example.\nLender targets 24% IRR. 6-month tenure. No upfront float (so F = 0).\n\\[\\text{Take\\%} = \\frac{(24\\% - 0\\%) \\cdot (6 + 1)}{24} + 1\\% + 2\\%\\] \\[= \\frac{24\\% \\times 7}{24} + 1\\% + 2\\%\\] \\[= 7\\% + 1\\% + 2\\%\\] \\[= 10\\%\\]\nBut they have upfront float. Assume they deploy capital upfront for 1.7 months (the effective float on a 6-month loan). That’s \\(\\frac{1.7}{6} \\approx 28\\%\\) of the funding period.\nFloat adjustment = 10% × 1.7 months of returns = roughly 1.7% reduction.\n\\[\\text{Adjusted Take\\%} \\approx 10\\% - 1.7\\% \\approx 8.3\\%\\]\nStep 4: The pitch.\n“You’re targeting 24% IRR. Opex is 1%, loss is 2%. That means you need ~8-9% total take on a 6-month loan. Let’s settle at 8.5%.”\nNow you have a defensible number. Not arbitrary. Math-based.",

    "text": "12.3 Questions to Ask Lenders\nWhen a lender pitches subvention, ask these six questions. Listen carefully to the answers:\n\n12.3.1 1. “What is your assumed lifetime loss rate?”\n\nGood answer: “2-3% for checkout finance, 1-1.5% for home loans.”\nRed flag answer: “5% for all products” or “I don’t know, we estimate it quarterly.”\nWhat to do: If they say 5% for 6-month checkout, they’re overestimating. Industry data suggests 2-3%. Push back.\n\n\n\n12.3.2 2. “Is that realized or buffered?”\n\nGood answer: “Realized. We track it monthly.”\nRed flag answer: “Buffered. We reserve 5% on day 1.”\nWhat to do: Buffering inflates opex. If they buffer high, they’re covering up for inefficiency.\n\n\n\n12.3.3 3. “What is your cost of funds?”\n\nGood answer: “10-12%, split between NCD borrowing (12%) and repo (9%).”\nRed flag answer: “It varies” or “I can’t share that.”\nWhat to do: Cost of funds is the biggest lever. If they quote 14-15%, they’re being greedy. Market rate for NBFCs is 10-12%.\n\n\n\n12.3.4 4. “What average outstanding assumption are you using?”\n\nGood answer: “Average of opening and closing, which is ~30% of loan amount for a 6-month tenure.”\nRed flag answer: “Full loan amount for the full tenure.”\nWhat to do: If they assume full amount, they’re overstating the interest they’ll earn. Challenge it.\n\n\n\n12.3.5 5. “What IRR does this imply?”\n\nGood answer: Lender can work backward from their subvention ask and confirm it drives 24% IRR (or whatever they targeted).\nRed flag answer: “I’m not sure” or “That’s confidential.”\nWhat to do: If they can’t show you the math, they’re winging it. Walk.\n\n\n\n12.3.6 6. “What alternative deployment yields do you have?”\n\nGood answer: “Personal loans at 20%, and home loans at 12%. Your 24% checkout IRR fits between high-risk and lower-risk.”\nRed flag answer: “Checkout is our only option.”\nWhat to do: Their alternatives matter. If they can’t deploy capital anywhere else, they’ll negotiate. If they have tons of high-yield opportunities, they won’t.",

    "section": "12.4 Red Flags in Subvention Asks",
    "text": "12.4 Red Flags in Subvention Asks\nWatch for these five red flags. If you see them, the lender is either incompetent or trying to squeeze you:\n\n12.4.1 1. Linear Math (the biggest mistake)\n“You want 6 months? That’s half of 12 months. So half of 12% subvention is 6%. Here’s ₹6 lakh.”\nWhy it’s wrong: The formula is not linear. A 6-month loan at 24% IRR doesn’t need half the subvention of a 12-month loan. The required subvention is: - 6 months: ~8% - 12 months: ~15%\nLinear thinking would predict 7.5%. Reality is higher because funding drag scales non-linearly with tenure.\n\n\n12.4.2 2. Ignoring Float\n“You’re deploying capital upfront. So your interest benefit is larger. But I’ll ignore that.”\nWhy it’s wrong: Upfront float is real value. If you deploy capital 2 months early, you earn 2 months of interest on that capital. That’s 1.5-2% reduction in required subvention. Never agree to a subvention that doesn’t account for your float.\n\n\n12.4.3 3. Inflated Loss Assumptions\n“I’m assuming 5% loss rate on checkout finance.”\nWhy it’s wrong: For 6-month checkout loans, industry loss rates are 2-3%. 5% is outlier-high. It pads opex. Push back with data.\n\n\n12.4.4 4. Monthly Loss Quoting\n“Our monthly loss is 3%.”\nWhy it’s wrong: That’s 36% annual loss! Nonsense. Losses should always be quoted as annual or as lifetime loss on the cohort. If someone quotes monthly, they’re either confused or lying.\n\n\n12.4.5 5. Tenure-Flat Subvention\n“We need 8% subvention for all tenures: 3 months, 6 months, 12 months.”\nWhy it’s wrong: 8% for 3 months is overpaying them. 8% for 12 months is underpaying them. The formula shows it should scale with tenure:\n\\[\\text{Take\\%} \\propto (n + 1)\\]\nSo subvention should increase with tenure. If a lender quotes flat subvention, they’re not thinking clearly. Or they’re using a loose all-in margin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nRed flag #1 (linear math) is the most common. Most executives, even smart ones, think checkout finance subvention linearly. It’s not. The formula is non-linear. If you remember one thing from this section, remember that.",

Non-linear.\nUpfront float reduces required subvention by ~1.5-2%.\nLoss rate for 6-month checkout is 2-3%, not 5%.\nCost of funds is the biggest lever. Push on it first.\nHigher opex = higher subvention. Digital platforms should have 0.5-1% opex, not 2%.\n“No-cost EMI” is a term for the customer. Subvention is the actual cost.\nIf the lender can’t explain the math, walk.
